- [ ] Installer and auto-updater system
- [ ] Documentation and user guides
- [ ] Community feedback integration

---

## Technical Considerations 

### Architecture Decisions
- **API Security**: How to safely store and manage user API keys
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure all AI interactions respect user privacy
- **Performance**: Balance feature richness with lightweight operation
- **Modularity**: Keep features optional and toggleable
- **Extensibility**: Design for future plugin/extension system

### Risk Assessment
- **Scope Creep**: This is indeed "ambitious AF" - need clear prioritization
- **API Costs**: User education about LLM API usage costs
- **Complexity**: Balance power-user features with simplicity
- **Resource Usage**: Maintain <256MB memory target with new features

---

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Memory usage remains under 256MB with all features active
- [ ] Handles 500+ audio files without performance degradation
- [ ] Supports 100+ todo lists with sub-second search
- [ ] LLM integration responds within 3 seconds
- [ ] Zero crashes during 24/7 operation testing
- [ ] User onboarding completes in under 2 minutes
